Webpack bundler with babel 7

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start developing
3. Run `npm run build` to compile, minify and bundle js

To start developing just go to src/index.js and hack away. Hot module replacement is included so you can see changes made on the fly. When done, production folder is `dist`.
